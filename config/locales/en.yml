# Files in the config/locales directory are used for internationalization
# and are automatically loaded by Rails. If you want to use locales other
# than English, add the necessary files in this directory.
#
# To use the locales, use `I18n.t`:
#
#     I18n.t 'hello'
#
# In views, this is aliased to just `t`:
#
#     <%= t('hello') %>
#
# To use a different locale, set it with `I18n.locale`:
#
#     I18n.locale = :es
#
# This would use the information in config/locales/es.yml.
#
# To learn more, please read the Rails Internationalization guide
# available at http://guides.rubyonrails.org/i18n.html.

That's where the EOL Learning + Education Group (L+E) comes in. Through creative partnerships with educators and institutions that support science literacy, and in collaboration with enthusiasts and amateur naturalists, we develop tools and services to view EOL’s biodiversity information in more manageable ways. For example, <a href='/places'>EOL Places</a> provides a geographic window to explore biodiversity using food webs, observations and games, while <a href='http://education.eol.org/cards/'>EOL Species Cards</a> are printable and easy to use in classroom activities to learn about organisms, their traits, adaptations and where they live."
