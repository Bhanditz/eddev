      %h2.welcome-hdr Welcome to Learning + Education at the Encyclopedia of Life
      %p.welcome-p The Encyclopedia of Life Learning + Education group (EOL L+E) is part of the larger EOL collaborative with a mission to make information about all life on Earth - microorganisms, plants and animals - freely available to anyone with access to the internet. EOL L+E works with educators, citizen scientists and partners to put this biodiversity information into context.
      %p.welcome-p Our website is in transition. At the moment, several of our resources are found on EOL or partner websites. Thank you for your patience and we look forward to hearing from you if you have questions or feedback.
